# Validation-of-CAF-Subtypes

## What are CAFs
Cancer-associated fibroblasts are a diverse set of stromal cells populating the tumor microenvironment (TME), easily recognized by a spindle-like nuclear and membrane structure.

They are widely responsible for shaping the extracellular matrix and the physico-chemical properties of the tumor, and executing pro- and anti-tumor functions by secreting proteases, cytokines, and growth factors that promote tumor growth, suppress immunity, and much more. CAFs receive a fraction of the attention given to immune cells, where heterogeneity is resolved by lymphoid/myeloid lineage and further by immune cell subtypes and exhaustion state. In contrast, CAFs have been defined as a monolith, expressing markers such as alpha-SMA or vimentin. More recently, CAF heterogeneity with clinical significance has been discovered via signaling such as podoplanin linked to poor outcomes. In 2023, deep single cell sequencing of fibroblast populations defined a

Training Data

## Objectives
###
Start with training Cords CAF snRNAseq
Celltypist 10-fold validation
Apply to Krughammer sc/snRNAseq, same sammples as slideseq, turn fibroblasts to 9-fibroblasts
Reannotate slideseq data with CAF subtypes, run RCTD
## Strategy
### Oversampled Input Data

### Understampled Input Data

INCLUDE STEPS AND WHICH DATA WAS USED STEP BY STEP
LIST TEAM MEMBERS
EXPLAIN RESULTS OF OUTPUTS, WHERE IT CAME FROM, BE EXPLICIT
LIST PLANNED FEATURES AND FUTURE IDEAS
DEFINE YOUR JARGON
LIST THE PROBLEMS
